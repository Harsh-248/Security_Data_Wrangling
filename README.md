# Security Data Wrangling

## Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for cybersecurity attack data. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze security-related datasets to extract meaningful insights.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses a cybersecurity dataset.
- Cleans missing values and removes duplicate entries.
- Splits and formats time-related columns for better analysis.
- Uses visualization techniques to analyze missing data.
- Applies statistical methods to explore trends in attack data.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy missingno
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-data-wrangling.git
   cd security-data-wrangling
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the data analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Security_Data_Wrangling.ipynb
   ```

## Files
